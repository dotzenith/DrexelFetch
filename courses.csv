The course also critiques American policing and proposes a reimagined police role that deemphasizes crime fighting and coercive control in favor of protecting life. Throughout the course, students will consider and reconsider the question: If coercion is the defining feature of the police, does every interaction between the police and public have to be coercive?."
CJS 240,"Seminar in Justice Informatics",3.0,"No Prereq","Justice Informatics. Digital Justice. Data Justice. These are the theoretical and ethical contexts that frame our discussions of how the government and other entities create, use, and archive data they have gathered about members of our society. Many people are familiar with predictive policing; we have heard the terms “racist algorithms” and “artificial intelligence." But few people actually know how these activities and concepts apply to our institutions of criminal justice, and how they often conflict with society's desire to secure privacy in a data-driven world.

CJS 270,"Crime Analysis Using Open Data",3.0,"No Prereq","We live a data rich world and “open data” initiatives have made unprecedented amounts of crime, criminal justice, demographic, and land use data available to academics, professionals, and citizens alike. The data are not useful unless we know what is available, how to access it, and what tools to use to make sense of it. Students will gain competence in each of these areas as we investigate: Why is open data, particularly related to crime and justice, so important? How can the availability of such data increase citizen participation in civil society? How might open data help us move toward a more just society? Should we become advocates for using the data? Students will conduct weekly exercises that focus on finding data and then getting actual and actionable information out of it and a final project."

CJS 280,"Communities and Crime",3.0,"No Prereq","This course introduces students to the ecological study of crime. Crime varies in time, space, and populations as it reflects neighborhood structures and the routine social interactions that occur in daily life. Concentrations of crime can be found among locations, with antisocial activities like assaults and theft occurring at higher rates because of the demographic make-up of people (e.g., adolescents) or conflicts (e.g., competing gangs), for reasons examined by ecological criminology. We examine variations in socio-demographic structures (age, education ratios, and the concentration of poverty) and the physical environment (housing segregation, density of bars, street lighting) predicts variations between neighborhoods in the level of crime and disorder."

JWST 224,"Judaism and Christianity: Two Religions or One?",3.0,"No Prereq","The relation between Christianity and Judaism is one of the most misunderstood in the history of thought. Christianity is often considered to be diametrically opposed to Judaism, to be a rejection of the Judaic worldview. Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther, have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge? This course endeavors to answer these important questions."

JWST 227,"History of Antisemitism",4.0,"No Prereq","For centuries, Jews have suffered prejudice, discrimination, and persecution. Jewish people have been vilified for denying the divinity of Jesus Christ; they were unjustly marked as murderers, usurers, and villains of all sorts; they were condemned for their supposed role in defiling and undermining the “white-race”; they were accused of committing the greatest abuses of capitalism, and at the same time, were charged with inventing socialism and Communism. What is antisemitism? How did it start? Why is it so enduring? This course will explore the long history of a perplexing and irrational phenomenon. This course will examine the racial, political, and economic forms of antisemitism in the ancient, medieval, and modern world."
JWST 228,"Antisemitism in America",4.0,"No Prereq","The past few years have shown that antisemitism is alive and well in the United States, in spite of a decades-long lull.
